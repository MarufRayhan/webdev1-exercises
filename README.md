# TUNI Web Development Course Exercises (Webdev1)

## About The Project
This repository contains my work for the Web Development 1 (Webdev1) course at Tampere University (TUNI). The course focuses on fundamental web development concepts and technologies, and this repository showcases my solutions to various exercises provided throughout the course.

### Structure
Each folder/directory in this repository corresponds to a specific exercise or set of exercises. The exercises were structured by the course instructors, providing a skeleton or base code upon which I had to build or modify to complete the tasks.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of these exercises are to demonstrate and solidify my understanding in key areas of web development, including but not limited to:
- HTML structure and semantics
- CSS styling and layout techniques
- Basic JavaScript programming and DOM manipulation
- Web accessibility standards

## My Approach
For each exercise, I followed the given questions or instructions closely, applying web development best practices to solve the problems and complete the tasks. This involved:
- Writing clean, well-commented, and efficient code
- Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness
- Implementing accessibility features to enhance user experience
- Debugging and testing to ensure functionality and reliability

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Setup and Usage
To view or use these exercises, you can clone this repository to your local machine and open the HTML files in a web browser. For exercises involving JavaScript, ensure that your browser allows JavaScript execution.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YourGitHubUsername]/webdev1-exercises.git
